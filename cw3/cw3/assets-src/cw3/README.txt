## Ship Model

The ship model ("NewShip.obj") is sourced from 

"TDA 362/DIT223 Tutorials"
http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/TDA362/tutorials/index.html

with permission from the tutorial's authors.

Its material definitions have been updated to provide the same parameters as
the models in CW~2. See NewShip.mtl.orig for unedited files. There are some
additional minor edits to the material file for CW3.
